# Backend Plugin Roadmap

This is probably misnamed but this is where I'll be documenting the features that need to be implemented for the backend plugin to entirely replace a proxy server.

- [x] Basic Numeric Queries 
- [ ] Complex Numeric Queries
- [ ] Fixed Time Window Interval Type
- [ ] Returning Complex Query components

Once the above features are implemented, this branch will be merged into master.
Currently there are no plans to support the old method of hitting a proxy server due to a lack of interest. If that would affect you, please open a github issue.
